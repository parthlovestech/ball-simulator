# Bouncing Balls Simulation

## Overview

This Python script simulates bouncing balls within a circular area. Each time a ball bounces, the total number of balls doubles. Additionally, there is a hole in the circle through which balls can pass, and balls that pass through this hole are removed from the simulation to prevent excessive rendering and crashes.

## Features

- **Bouncing Balls**: Balls bounce off the circle's boundary and double in number each time they bounce.
- **Hole in Circle**: Balls that pass through a designated hole in the circle are removed to manage rendering load.
- **Dynamic Ball Count**: The total number of balls is updated in real-time and displayed on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
